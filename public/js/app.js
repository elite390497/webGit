	// Right, this is really confusing and there is a lot of maths going on here
	// The gist of the problem is here: https://gist.github.com/nnnick/696cc9c55f4b0beb8fe9
	//
	// Reaction: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/34601363/toomuchscience.gif
	//
	// Solution:
	//
	// We assume the radius of the polygon is half the size of the canvas at first
	// at each index we check if the text overlaps.
	//
	// Where it does, we store that angle and that index.
	//
	// After finding the largest index and angle we calculate how much we need to remove
	// from the shape radius to move the point inwards by that x.
	//
	// We average the left and right distances to get the maximum shape radius that can fit in the box
	// along with labels.
	//
	// Once we have that, we can find the centre point for the chart, by taking the x text protrusion
	// on each side, removing that from the size, halving it and adding the left x protrusion width.
	//
	// This will mean we have a shape fitted to the canvas, as large as it can be with the labels
	// and position it in the most space efficient manner
	//

//	Implementation Summary
//
//	1. Enforce API surface and semantic compatibility with 1.9.x branch
//	2. Improve the module's maintainability by reducing the storage
//		paths to a single mechanism.
//	3. Use the same single mechanism to support "private" and "user" data.
//	4. _Never_ expose "private" data to user code (TODO: Drop _data, _removeData)
//	5. Avoid exposing implementation details on user objects (eg. expando properties)
//	6. Provide a clear path for implementation upgrade to WeakMap in 2014
